\title{Creates a quick hexbin plot to check the relationship between two reads objects}
\usage{
hexbinPlot(x, y, binSize, log = FALSE, nrBins = 40, chrom = NULL,
  fragLen = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ChIPdata} object that corresponds to the x-axis}

\item{y}{Another \code{ChIPdata} object, this one correspond to the y-axis}

\item{binSize}{A integer value used to partition the chromosome}

\item{log}{A logical flag that indicates if log10 scale is going to be used in the axes. The default value is FALSE}

\item{nrBins}{Integer value with the number of bins used to build the plot. The default value is 100}

\item{chrom}{A GRanges object specifying the genome to bin. The maximum length used to create the bins
is gonna be used the integer part of (chromLen / fragLen) times fragLen for each chromosome.}

\item{fragLen}{An integer value used to extend the fragments. The default value is one, to count only the 5' ends 
that overlaps the bins}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with the hexbin plot
}
\description{
Creates a quick hexbin plot to visualize the relationship between 
two reads objects
